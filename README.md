# GTM Skills by Extruct

Run outbound campaigns end-to-end with [Extruct](https://www.extruct.ai) and [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills). Research, list building, enrichment, segmentation, email generation, and sending. Use one [skill](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) or combine several. Each works independently.

For updates, follow [Danny Chepenko on LinkedIn](https://br.linkedin.com/in/danielchepenko).

## Getting Started

### 1. Install skills

Via [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) CLI ([repo](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills)):

```
npx skills add extruct-ai/gtm-skills
```

Or via [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) plugin manager:

```
/plugin marketplace add extruct-ai/gtm-skills
/plugin install gtm-skills
```

Skills are stored in `~/.claude/skills/`. Install once, use everywhere across all your projects.

**Updating:** re-run `npx skills add extruct-ai/gtm-skills` to pull the latest version, or `npx skills update` to update all installed skills at once. For the plugin manager, run `/plugin marketplace update` to refresh and get the latest versions.

### 2. Get your Extruct API token

Sign up at [extruct.ai](https://www.extruct.ai) (free plan with 25 monthly credits) and grab your API token from the dashboard.

The token is needed for company search, table creation, enrichment, and people search. Skills that don't call the Extruct API (context-building, hypothesis-building, email-prompt-building, email-generation) work without it.

Set the token in your terminal:

```
export EXTRUCT_API_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

If you skip this step, skills will ask for the token in chat when they need it.

### 3. Run your first workflow

Describe what you need in Claude Code:

**Start from your website:**

```
I'm building www.example.com.
Read my website, figure out my ICP,
and draft a plan for an outbound campaign.
```

**Start from a win case:**

```
I'm building www.example.com.
One of my customers is www.customer.com,
they use us to score suppliers.
Find similar companies and plan a campaign.
```

**Start from a list of won deals:**

```
I'm building www.example.com.
Here's a list of my won deals [attach CSV].
Analyze them and find similar companies to target.
```

Each prompt triggers plan mode. Claude will research, ask clarifying questions, and propose a step-by-step campaign plan before executing.

### Campaign Artifacts

Skills automatically create a `claude-code-gtm/` directory with all intermediate files:

```
claude-code-gtm/
├── context/
│   ├── {company}_context.md          ← ICP, voice, proof points
│   └── {vertical-slug}/             ← per-vertical research + hypotheses
├── prompts/
│   └── {vertical-slug}/             ← email prompt templates
└── csv/
    ├── input/{campaign-slug}/       ← segmented lists, people, contacts
    └── output/{campaign-slug}/      ← generated emails
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Service | Used by |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `EXTRUCT_API_TOKEN` | [Extruct API](https://www.extruct.ai/docs) | list-building, list-enrichment, table-creation, people-search, list-segmentation, email-search |

Other providers' credentials (email enrichment, sequencing, deep research) are requested in chat when the corresponding skill runs.
